**Caribou and Arctic Fox**: 

- The caribou eat lichens when the temperature gets super cold. 
    * Often, itâ€™s the only available food they have, but does provide them with nourishing carbohydrates for heat and energy. 
- The arctic fox instinctively knows to follow the caribou since the caribou helps the fox get its food as well by unintentionally digging up subnivean mammals as it finds its own food to eat.
- The fox benefits from the caribou, while the caribou is left uneffected.
