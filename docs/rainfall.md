The tundra is classified as a desert due to its low annual precipitation, which typically ranges from 6 to 10 inches (15–25 cm) annually, including melted snow. In the taiga or northern forests, precipitation is higher, averaging around 12–33 inches (30–85 cm) annually, with most of it falling as snow in winter or as rain in the short summer months.
